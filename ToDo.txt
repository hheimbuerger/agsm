v1.2:
• ???





v2.0:
    GUI:
    • define minimum size for window
    • change mouse cursor to hourglass while processing?
    • second colon in output filename leads to weird bug
    • replace the ugly file/dir pickers with editbox+icon
    • double-buffering / get rid of preview flickering
    • optimise process of creating empty preview imagebox
    • save GUI window size/position
    
    Processing:
    • support Slipstream GUI
    • do some profiling on the actual merging process and optimise progress bar
    • free cropped images asap / reduce memory usage
    • add button to open merged image in image editor
    • optionally delete merged images
    • find a better font for the line at the bottom, Arial isn't very well readable at this size (and probably not anti-aliased)
    
    Error handling/reporting:
    • catch&log any unexpected exceptions occuring during merging
    • show proper error message for unexpected exceptions from the GUI
    • log exceptions from processing or GUI and allow them to be automatically submitted
    • implement 'check for updates'
